> I've learned a lot since joining [Gengo](http://gengo.com) as a [junior software engineer](http://careers.gengo.com).

I mentioned that enthusiastically as my supervisor reviewed my performance after a year with Gengo.

At that moment, it struck me that I should combine my love for Markdown and the desire to keep track of useful stuff that made me a less lousy programmer than my yesterday self.

Hence, this mini blog is a collection of code snippets (hopefully, recorded on a daily basis) I learned while on the job.
